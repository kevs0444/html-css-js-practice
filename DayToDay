Below is a detailed 56-day, day-by-day roadmap to upskill in web development during your school vacation (June 11, 2025 – August 4, 2025), focusing on frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and transitioning to backend (PHP, MySQL) to align with your full-stack developer goal. Each day includes 4–5 hours of structured learning and practice, split into tutorials, coding, and review/community engagement. The plan is intensive, project-based, and builds progressively, starting with the HTML foundation you requested. I’ve included a sample HTML project for Day 1 and ensured the roadmap is practical for 4–5 hours daily. By the end, you’ll have a deployed portfolio with full-stack projects.

- **Breaks**: Split 4–5 hours into 2–3 sessions (e.g., 2 hours morning, 2–3 hours evening).
- **Projects**: Save all code in a “WebDev_Vacation” folder, push to GitHub daily.
- **Community**: Post daily progress on X (#WebDev) for feedback and motivation.
- **Debugging**: Use Chrome DevTools for frontend, XAMPP logs for PHP.
- **Portfolio**: Aim for 3–5 projects (portfolio, to-do list, weather app, blog, e-commerce).
- **Next Steps**: After August 5, explore React/Node.js or prep for job applications.
